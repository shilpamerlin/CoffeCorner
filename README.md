# iOS - CoffeeCorner: A Coffee Ordering App
## Simple app for a Coffee Shop that cashier can use to take and manage orders.
### Description:
This app can be used by any Coffee shop where cashier can use to take and manage orders. This app is being developed using MVVM architecture pattern by using the Apple's object graph and persistence framework - Core Data. This App contains two modules. First module(CoffeeOrder) which shows the lists of orders made by individual customers. The order data will be saved in Core Data and retreived when the app loads. The second module is AddCoffeeOrder, where the new coffee has been added and will be saved to Core Data. Once the order is successful, the app shows the current orders including the newly added one. Order can be deleted from Core Data once the order is completed
#### Main concepts implemented in this app:
1. MVVM architecture 
2. Saving, retreving and deleting order details from Core Data
3. Working with Segmented Control
4. Impmentation of Tableview and custom tableview cells
